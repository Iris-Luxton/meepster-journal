# meepster-journal
This is my capstone project that I will expand indefinitely over my programming career.

Meepster journal is my learning diary that gather in depth all aspects of Japanese language.
Include in this site, I am trying to make:

1. Japanese learning app that is designed for you to pass JLPT
This app will allow you to log in with a user name and password to track your progress
The design aims to make it fun and give you satisfaction of clearing a level - sense of victory and progress

2. A bit of travelling / cultural / resource / book sharing hub that will help with your learning

3. A bit of Japanese game review blog that helps you learn Japanese through playing game
